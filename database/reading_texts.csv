"Extract A: from Picnic at Hanging Rock by Joan Lindsay
They were off; the College already out of sight except for the tower through the trees as they
bowled along the level Melbourne-Bendigo road, vibrating with particles of fine red dust. ‘Get
up Sailor, you lazy brute … Prince, Belmonte, get back in your collars …’ For the first mile or
two, the scenery was familiar through the girls’ daily perambulation in crocodile formation.
The passengers knew only too well, without bothering to look out, how the scraggy stringy
bark forest lined the road on either side, now and then opening out onto a lighter patch of
cleared land. The Comptons’ whitewashed cottage whose sprawling quince trees supplied
the College with jellies and jams, the clump of wayside willows at which the governess in
charge would invariably call a halt and head for home. It was the same in Longman’s
Highroads of History, where the class were forever turning back for recapitulation at the
death of King George the Fourth before starting off again with Edward the Third next term …
Now the willows in rich summer green were gaily passed and a sense of adventure ahead
took over as heads began to peer through the buttoned tarpaulin flaps of the horse-drawn
coach.
At Mrs Appleyard’s college SILENCE WAS GOLDEN, written up in the corridors and often
imposed. There was a delicious freedom about the swift steady motion of the coach and
even in the warm dusty air blowing up in their faces that set the passengers chirping and
chattering like budgerigars.
The road to Hanging Rock turns sharply away to the right a little way out of the township of
Woodend. Here Mr Hussey pulled up outside the leading hotel to rest and water his horses
before starting on the last lap of the drive. Already the heat inside the vehicle was oppressive
and there was a wholesale peeling off of the obligatory gloves. ‘Can’t we take our hats off
too, Mam’selle?’ asked Irma whose ink-black curls were flowing out in a warm tide under the
brim of her stiff school sailor. Mademoiselle smiled and looked across at Miss McCraw,
sitting opposite, awake and vertical, but with two closed eyes, two puce kid hands locked
together on her lap. ‘Certainly not. Because we are on an excursion, there is no necessity to
look like a wagon load of street urchins.’
The rhythmic beat of the horses’ hooves combined with the close air of the coach was
making them all sleepy. As it was still only eleven o’clock, with plenty of time in which to
reach the picnic grounds for lunch, the governesses conferred and Mr Hussey was requested
to let down the steps of the coach at a suitable spot off the road. In the shade of an old white
gum the zinc-lined wicker basket that kept the milk and lemonade deliciously cool was taken
out and unpacked, hats were removed without further comment and biscuits handed round.
Extract B: from The Family Law by Benjamin Law
My family isn’t the outdoors type. Despite being raised on the coast, Mum detested visits to
the beach (all the sand it brought into the house), while Dad disapproved of wearing thongs
(‘It splits the toes’). We never camped. All those things involved in camping – pitching a tent;
cooking on open fires; the insects; sleeping on rocks – they never appealed to us.
We preferred theme parks. For parents raising five children, theme parks made so much
sense. They were clean and safe. There were clearly designated activities, and auditory and
visual stimuli that transcended racial, language and age barriers. Also, you could buy heaps
of useless souvenirs.
It was a family tradition that once a year, our family of seven (eight, including my
grandmother) would cram ourselves into a 1990 grey five-seat automatic Honda. ",1,3

 Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps

"Extract A
Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again. It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to
the drive, and for a while I could not enter, for the way was barred to me. There was a padlock
and chain upon the gate. I called in my dream to the lodge-keeper, and had no answer, and
peering closer through the rusted spokes of the gate I saw that the lodge was uninhabited. Then,
like all dreamers, I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers and passed like a spirit
through the barrier before me. The drive wound away in front of me, twisting and turning as it had
always done, but as I advanced I was aware that a change had come upon it; it was narrow and
unkempt, not the drive that we had known. At first I was puzzled, and it was only when I bent my
head to avoid the low swinging branch of a tree that I realized what had happened. Nature had
come into her own again and, little by little, in her stealthy, insidious way had encroached upon
the drive with long, tenacious fingers. Extract B
Why do we feel the urge to talk about our dreams? We like to talk about dreams to help us
prepare for how to act in dangerous situations in the future. Most of your dreams are going to
seem pretty boring to most people. But if you’re going to talk about some of your dreams, pick the
ones in which you deal with a problem in some new way. This would make them more interesting
than your happy dreams, and if you feel that you learned something about how to deal with a
threat, maybe your audience will, too.
We tend to think of dreams as being really weird, but in truth, about 80 percent of dreams depict
ordinary situations. We’re just more likely to remember and talk about the strange or dangerous
ones. Information we do not understand can often rouse our curiosity, particularly in the presence
of strong emotion. The emotional pull of dreams makes even the strangest incongruities seem
meaningful and worthy of discussion and interpretation.
Extract C
One morning, when I was younger, I gave a detailed description of my previous night’s dream to
my mother. When I finished, she said, “I’m going to tell you something. Don’t ever share your
dreams with anyone. It’s boring to listen to other people’s dreams.” I was offended at first. But of
course she was right; it’s almost always deadly to hear other people talk about their dreams. As a
rule, dreams die in the glare of the waking world, their shimmering aura evaporating in the harsh
air outside the psyche. And yet, paradoxically, it’s the emotional aura of dreams that makes them
feel so urgently worth sharing in the first place.
I still share my dreams – just not verbally. Like so many other writers (and artists too) I employ
dreams in my creative work. They’re an engine, a lending library. It’s a thrill to awake with a
strange, arresting image in mind, or still grasping the thread of an allegorical dream story.
Extract D
For the first time in a long while, I had a dream which I feel like writing down. This was a dream
where I was auditioning for an acting job, and the dream went lucid; I realized that what was going
on was a dream. So, as I often do in these situations, I chilled out and tried not to actively do
anything; I often like to just see what the dream reveals. A nondescript person came up to me and
handed me a small white book with gold lettering. ""Remember this book,"" said the person,
""because when you wake up you're going to want to get a copy. Really remember it."" I thanked
them and looked at the book in my hand. There was a title and author's name written on it, but I
couldn't interpret the text. I'd look at it, trying to remember what it said, then I'd look away, and
when I looked back it said something completely different and I was unable to remember what I'd
just read.
There’s a great Batman episode all about this! Sometimes I can fully recall bits of dreamed text,
but on waking after other dreams, it’s all gone. ",3,3
